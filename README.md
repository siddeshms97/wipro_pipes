Python program to automate the process of the process of transferring the pipes from the warehouse to the carrier truck. There are N pipes in the warehouse placed vertically along a wall. In the automated system, a drone picks the pipes by length and carries them to the carrier truck.

The drone repeats this process  until it has no more pipes to pick
